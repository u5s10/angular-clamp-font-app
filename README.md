# ClampFont

Small angular app made for calculating clamp font size needed for fluid typography. Project was made in attempt to make calculating font-size quick and easy. Here's an [article](https://css-tricks.com/simplified-fluid-typography/) on fluid typography that inspired me to make this tool.

## Live demo
